<h1>Ticket Counter</h1>
<p>This is a ticket counter built in React + Typescript. Each counter manages its own state and all the components are generated intutively.</p>
<p>You can perform one of four actions to each employee card:
<ul><li>Open a new ticket to assign a new task</li>
<li>Close a ticket when the task is completed</li>
<li>Delete a ticket to remove a task from the employee</li>
<li>Reopen a ticket to revise the work done</li></ul></p>
<p>To help you find the right employee easily, you can filter the employees by name or role</p>
